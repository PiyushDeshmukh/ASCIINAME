# ASCIINAME
A tool that displays text in ASCII art form.

To run this script, you need python and c++ installed on your LINUX machine.

It is written in python 2.7.6. It is recommended to place the script in a separate directory as it will generate some files during runtime.

To run the script, type `python asciiart.py` in terminal

The script will generate a c++ file which when executed shall convert a text into ASCII art. It also will compile the .cpp file and create an executable which will be run with the help of the OS module in python. Please notice that this  script does not delete the generated temp files automatically.
